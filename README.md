# BinaryClock
This project was created in my 1A term at the University of Waterloo, in collaboration with Caleb Choi and Anshuman Banka.
The program contained in this repository implements a clock suite. Capable of running its programs in parallel, the suite is equipped with time of day, stopwatch and timer functionality. The code is used to program an Arduino MEGA, which is contained inside the cardboard shell of the clock -- the outside of the box displays the time on an LED binary counter and on an LCD screen.  Additionally, users can interact with the suite via buttons installed in the face of the clock.  Housed in a small cardboard box, the project is a 24-hour adjustable clock that is displayed through a character LCD screen, along with an LED binary counter. By analyzing function runtime, we can made adjustments to the time stored in memory, to ensure that the time displayed is accurate.

Unfortunately, there are no videos of the finished product.  However there exists a video of one of the later tests, which demonstrates many of the clocks' capabilities, found here: https://streamable.com/98c4s
